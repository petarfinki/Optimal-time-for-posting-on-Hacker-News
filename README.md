# Optimal time for posting on Hacker News

The project is an analysis, comparison and research on all kinds of postings on the "Hacker News" web platform. Hacker News (sometimes abbreviated as HN) is a social news website focusing on computer science and entrepreneurship.

Throughout the ipynb file, you are provided with a step-by-step guidance and intro/concluding remarks.

The work is done all by myself individually, not in correlation with faculty or others.
